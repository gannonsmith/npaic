All life I've been on the run. A couple years later, some soldiers captured my mother, took her somewhere. We never saw her again. We drifted around... He was a very sad man and the drink had a mean hold on him. Around thirteen... I just took off on my own. </Charles Smith> <Hosea Matthews> That was about the age we found young Arthur here, maybe a little older. A wilder delinquent you never did see.

All life I've been on the run. A couple years later, some soldiers captured my mother, took her somewhere. We never saw her again. We drifted around... He was a very sad man and the drink had a mean hold on him. Around thirteen... I just took off on my own. </Charles Smith> <Hosea Matthews> That was about the age we found young Arthur here, maybe a little older. A wilder delinquent you never did see. But he learned fast. </Hosea Matthews>

I mean, I don't know if he personally sanctioned any of this or not. This is the other problem, there's a culture now in his regiment... the rot has traveled down the trunk. </Lyndon Monroe> <Arthur Morgan> Okay, well, just show me where to find this wagon, and I'll get the medicine for you. You don't need to be involved. </Arthur Morgan> <Lyndon Monroe> Thank you, Mr. Morgan. But I must ask you to please be discrete. We really cannot afford more conflict.

We love big clients... and we love cash. Our branch alone, here in town, has more cash reserves on site than any bank in the entire country... outside of Wall Street and San Francisco. </Gilbert Knightly> <Hosea Matthews> Well, perhaps we could discuss it further one day, Mr. Knightly. When it comes to bankers, I drive a hard bargain... but I'm very fair in business. </Hosea Matthews> <Gilbert Knightly> I would at least like the opportunity to show you our business. </Gilbert Knightly> <Hosea Matthews> Thank you, thank you very much! </Hosea Matthews> <Gilbert Knightly> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find my fiancee. </Gilbert Knightly> <Hosea Matthews> Of course.

All life I've been on the run. A couple years later, some soldiers captured my mother, took her somewhere. We never saw her again. We drifted around... He was a very sad man and the drink had a mean hold on him. Around thirteen... I just took off on my own. </Charles Smith> <Hosea Matthews> That was about the age we found young Arthur here, maybe a little older. A wilder delinquent you never did see. But he learned fast. </Hosea Matthews> <Arthur Morgan> Not as fast as Marston, apparently. </Arthur Morgan> <Charles Smith> Wait... I don't understand.
