        "Hosea Matthews: Listen, Dutch, I ain\u2019t trying to undermine you, just\u2026 I just want to stick to the plan\u2026 which was to lie low, then head back out west. Now suddenly, we\u2019re about to roh a train.",

We\u2019re going to pick it off after it crosses the border into the Grizzlies. There\u2019s a raised spot there that should give us good vantage. Charles, you\u2019ll keep lookout for any outriders. How\u2019s that hand, by the way?",

        "Dutch van der Linde: Good. I\u2019ll take the driver and engineer, then run point. Lenny and Javier, you two take the front cars, deal with any guards. Arthur and Micah, you head straight for the back. That\u2019s what we\u2019re after\u2026 Mr. Cornwall\u2019s private car.",

All life I\u2019ve been on the run. A couple years later, some soldiers captured my mother, took her somewhere. We never saw her again. We drifted around\u2026 He was a very sad man and the drink had a mean hold on him. Around thirteen\u2026 I just took off on my own.",

It\u2019s just\u2026 you know, maybe it\u2019s me who\u2019s changed, not him, but, we kept telling him that ferry job didn\u2019t feel right.

A lot of fellers bait then shoot from the trees\u2026 but I prefer to hunt on the ground. More dangerous, but\u2026 we\u2019ll have a much better chance of getting a good shot in\u2026 and if he bolts we can start right off after him. Can you mix up this bait for me while I finish packing us up? Fish, berries. Tie it up in that rag when you\u2019re done.",

        "Hosea Matthews: Not too much farther. Anyway, you two never told me properly about that business with Cornwall in Valentine? What happened there? Apart from scaring the living daylights out of Mr. Strauss.",
        "Arthur Morgan: That was about the only upside. John and I didn\u2019t even have time to get paid for the sheep we rustled.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: It is safe to Mr. Cornwall isn\u2019t a man to let bygones be bygones.",

        "Dutch van der Linde: We\u2019ve had closer shaves, but not that many",

        "Hosea Matthews: Yes\u2026 Jack told me you were a good teacher when you took him fishing. I said he must have you confused with someone else. (laughs)",
        "Arthur Morgan: So, you\u2019re going back to see that Sheriff Gray?",
        "Dutch van der Linde: Yeah, I don\u2019t see why not. They don\u2019t know who we are down here.",
        "Arthur Morgan: He didn\u2019t seem the sharpest of tacks. Neither did that deputy.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: If he thinks we can be useful to him, he can certainly be useful to us. A little hiding in plain sight.",
        "Arthur Morgan: I feel like we\u2019re always hiding in plain sight.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: But sometimes more smartly than others.",
        "Hosea Matthews: This is the spot, down to the left there. I saw some boats around last time. Be good to get to deeper water.",

        "Hosea Matthews: Yes, good.",
        "[They dismount from their horses at the two boats lying on the shore.]",

        "Dutch van der Linde: Okay\u2026 come on, Arthur, let\u2019s get her in the water.",
        "Hosea Matthews: I got a good feeling about fishing here\u2026 supposed to be some incredible sturgeon.",
        "Arthur Morgan: Okay, here we go. Let me row\u2026 you boys are too old for real labor no more.",
        "Hosea Matthews: And you\u2019re too dumb for anything else. (laughs)",
        "Arthur Morgan: You\u2019re still too quick for me, old man.",
        "Hosea Matthews: I enjoy picking on children\u2026 Now take us to the deeper water\u2026 and pray for\u2026 good luck and stupid fish.",
        "Arthur Morgan: But what about stupid luck and good fish?",
        "Hosea Matthews: That\u2019ll do too. Get us a bit deeper. I think here\u2019s good.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: Alright, good luck gentlemen.",
        "Hosea Matthews: Should really come here at dawn or dusk. That\u2019s when you catch the best fish. We should use a lake lure, that\u2019ll give us a much better chance of hooking something big like a sturgeon.",
        "Arthur Morgan: What\u2019s wrong with a good old worm?",
        "Hosea Matthews: Worms are good for tiddlers like bluegill and rockbass, but you\u2019d have to be real lucky to catch a sturgeon with one.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: Lures it is then. You heard the expert, Arthur. Let\u2019s bait up.",
        "Hosea Matthews: Keep the lure moving slowly on the water so it looks like a little fish just asking to be eaten. You got a bite. You hooked him.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: I think that\u2019s a bite. There, hooked him.",
        "Arthur Morgan: Hey, look at this beauty.",
        "Hosea Matthews: There you go.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: Well done, Arthur.",
        "Hosea Matthews: They can grow a lot bigger than that. Feller told me he once saw a monster lake sturgeon near the mouth of the river just southwest of Saint Denis. Fifty-pounder, he reckoned.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: I\u2019d like to see that.",
        "Arthur Morgan: Hey, I reckon we call it a day, fellers.",
        "Hosea Matthews: Already?",
        "Arthur Morgan: You ain\u2019t been chasing down outlaws.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: Alright, think we got a decent haul here. Pearson will be happy. Should we head back?",
        "Hosea Matthews: We could keep the boat, not too far back to camp from here.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: Good idea, could be useful.",
        "Arthur Morgan: What about the horses?",
        "Dutch van der Linde: Oh, they\u2019ll find their way back.",
        "Hosea Matthews: Just follow the shore south, Arthur.",
        "Dutch van der Linde: That was fun. Thanks you boys. Now, Hosea\u2026",

        "Dutch van der Linde: That was\u2026 that was pretty good\u2026 but you know what song we should be singing?",
        "Hosea Matthews: What?",
        "Dutch van der Linde: Well, look at us\u2026 three mariners.",
        "Hosea Matthews: Ah, of course.",
        "Dutch, Arthur &amp; Hosea: (singing) Well, we be three poor mariners, newly come from the seas. We spend our lives in jeopardy, while others live at ease. Shall we go dance this round a round a round\u2026 shall we go dance this round a round a round. And he that is a bully boy\u2026 come pledge me on this ground, a ground, a ground.

Now, Ram\u00f3n Cortez is round those parts, split up from his gang, and stuck in West Elizabeth. It\u2019s gotta be him, holed up waiting on some out\u2026 and we\u2019re gonna get to him first.",

        "Sadie Adler: And not much law except the Sheriff of Tumbleweed. He\u2019s making a hell of a go of it, but there ain\u2019t much there to hold back the chaos. It\u2019s real wild country.",
        "John Marston: Sounds like he needs all the help he can get.",
        "Sadie Adler: Maybe drop in on him some time.",
        "John Marston: You know I had some trouble of my own. That gang you was talking about\u2026 was they the Skinner Brothers?",

        "John Marston: So everyone with a price on their head deserves it, you think?",
        "Sadie Adler: Sure\u2026 no\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 usually. If I got into who deserved what, second-guessed every poster, I\u2019d tear out all my hair before I put a rope on anyone. If the price is high enough, you got to trust there\u2019s a reason they set it.",
        "John Marston: I hope that rationale works out\u2026 for all of us.",
        "Sadie Adler: Hold up. Down there. A fire. I\u2019d wager that\u2019s them. Stay on the road, let\u2019s find a good vantage point. Up here.

You got them? You ain\u2019t getting away from here! Get them! Put your gun on the boat. Make him turn around. Much as you want to, don\u2019t kill him. Much as you want to, don\u2019t kill him.",

        "[During the credits we see shots of the happy life of the Marston family; the appearance of the first policemen; Mr. Pearson, working in a store and apparently happy; Mrs. Downs and her son boarding a steamer; Sadie recuperating at the farm and leaving; Arthur's overgrown grave with the inscription \"blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness\"; Mary visits Arthur's grave and weeps; John teaches his son how to tend his horse while the Pinkertons watch him through binoculars; the old chief Rain Falls looks out over the plain from the top of a high mountain. After the credits, we return briefly to the farm.]",
